<h1>Need for Speed Most Wanted</h1>
        <p>Need for Speed Most Wanted is a 2005 open-world racing video game, and the ninth installment in the Need for Speed series. Developed by EA Canada and EA Black Box and published by Electronic Arts, it was released on November 11, 2005.</p>
    <h2>Police Pursuits</h2>
        <p>When players become engaged in a police pursuit, usually from conducting a traffic offence (referred to as &quot;Infractions&quot; in the game) in sight of a police unit (such as speeding), their aim at this point is to escape from the pursuit by either evading or taking out pursuing vehicles. The game's on-screen HUD is modified during a pursuit, including highlighting pursuing police units on the mini-map, displaying the vehicle's heat level, and adding a Pursuit bar at the bottom detailing the number of police units in the pursuit, how many have been evaded, and how many have been taken out. The pursuit system calculates how the police handle the player via the heat level accumulated against the player's current car. Heat accumulates from committing offences and continually evading capture by the police, with higher levels of heat causing the police to be more aggressive, from employing additional tactics and tools (such as roadblocks, spike strips, and police helicopters), to involving stronger, faster police cars such as police SUVs and Federal units.</p>
        <p>Players can lose the police through skillful driving, making use of their special abilities, ramming pursuing vehicles and utilizing &quot;Pursuit Breakers&quot; – environmental traps, highlighted on the mini-map, which when triggered cause a certain number of police vehicles to be taken out of action, such as smashing through a gas station. Evading and losing the police – either by disabling/immobilizing vehicles, gaining some distance from pursuers, or a combination of both – does not end a pursuit, once there are no more active vehicles. Instead, the player enters a &quot;cooldown&quot; period when this happens, which pauses the pursuit (and any reinforcements being called in), they must hide and avoid being spotted by police for a period of time. The length of time for this period is longer at higher levels of heat but can be decreased significantly if the player reaches and hides in special concealment spots around the game's setting, which are marked on the mini-map during this phase and are used to place them out of sight of police units. A pursuit fully ends when the player successfully escapes the police, or is overwhelmed and trapped, and thus &quot;busted&quot; as a result.</p>

    <h2>Setting</h2>
        <p>Most Wanted takes place in the fictional city of Rockport, which consists of three major districts: Rosewood, Camden Beach and Downtown Rockport. The city consists of areas featuring grimy industrial complexes, affluent suburbs, mountainous and wooded surroundings, a university campus, and a downtown core, with a mixture of road networks ranging from coastal roads to major highways. The setting is heavily influenced by cities from across the United States' &quot;Rust Belt&quot; and Pacific Northwest, with some resemblances to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon. Much of the game's events and story take place in a fixed time period between sunrise and sunset, compared to the previous title's races that took place at night.</p>

    <h2>Reception</h2>
        <p>Need for Speed: Most Wanted was met with positive reviews. GameSpot praised the game for its &quot;sharp graphics&quot; and &quot;outstanding sound effects&quot;, but noted the AI for being sometimes easy at first, and sometimes hard at later stages. IGN praised the map design, describing it as &quot;a crazily chromed out, sepia-tone landscape of industrial structures&quot;, the car modelling, the car line up and the return of exotics. Particularly strong praise was given to the police system, saying that the cops continually grow in aggressiveness and numbers and they add component of challenge, annoyance, and heat that makes this game challenging and entertaining. Praise even went to the cut-scenes and their casting, which usually falls victim to critics, saying that this mixture of animated, highly coloured FMV characters and stylized backgrounds is both imaginative and refreshing. During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded Most Wanted with &quot;Racing Game of the Year&quot;, along with a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Character Performance - Female&quot;.</p>
